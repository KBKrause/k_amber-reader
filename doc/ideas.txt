-Batch commands
-Polymorphic stuff with filereader and filewriter
-csv generator
-dihedral angles
FIXES:

SUGGESTIONS:
FileManipulator
	-MAke FileManipulator an abstract class. Fmanip is useless on its own. it DOES need to be instantiated
	for each file path.
	-Give it static methods.
	-Check where file paths are given. Do not allow empty strings unless in default ctor.
	-Check what is and is not inherited by derived classes.
	Some functionality is not necessary.


OTHER USEFUL THINGS:
-generate xcel files
-generate diagrams/pictures/graphs/etc.
-generate shell files for input, cpptraj, etc

THINGS TO BOIL DOWN:
-filereading open/close specific functions
-filewriting open/close specific functions

README:
-add prerequisities
-tests
-installation
-versioning
-contribution

QUESTIONS:
	-M or P: Multiple return statements in a file. good or bad?
	-M: Function pointers with class
	-P: best way to process command line options
	-M or P: how to decide to throw exceptions or have a "bad return code"?

FileReader derived classes
	RoGReader (radius of gyration)
